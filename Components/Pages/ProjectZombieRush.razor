<h3>Zombie Rush</h3>
This is my portfolio piece, a solo project developed during my third year at University.
It is a top-down, wave based zombie shooter game. Unfortunately, I no longer have access to the repository since leaving university, but I did create a blog which details the development process.

<p>This is my final solo project, developed during my third year at University.
It is a top-down shooter featuring upgrade trees, an inventory system,
saving and loading progress, and more.</p>

<p>This short video shows a few of my game's features. The enemies find the player using an A* pathfinding algorithm,
    and I am able to purchase a new weapon using coins and switch between my owned weapons which have different stats.</p>

        <figcaption style="text-align:left">This code runs at the start of every round. The Wave Manager object checks if a spawner object is off screen before spawning an enemy.
            First, it selects a random spawner from the list, then checks if the spawner's isOnScreen variable is false.
            If it is, it runs the spawner's SpawnEnemy method. If it is on screen, it repeats this method until an off-screen spawner is found.
            <br>This means that enemies always spawn off-screen which prevents enemies spawning directly on the player.</figcaption>

        <figcaption style="text-align:left">This script is run when the player upgrades their handgun, in the upgrade menu seen in the video above.
        <br>First, I check the player owns the gun, then, if they have not bought all the upgrades and can afford the upgrade,
        the coins are deducted from the player's total and the gun is upgraded.</figcaption>

        <figcaption style="text-align:left">This is the code for switching between weapons. Looking at EquipItem1, you can see the equipped item
        is changed to the first one in the list, but then I use a switch statement to check what weapon is equipped.
        <br>This is because the player could've obtained the weapons in any order. Then, I set the player's damage and fire rate values to the 
        weapon with the matching ID to what is equipped.</figcaption>
